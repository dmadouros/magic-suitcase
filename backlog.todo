Icebox:
 ☐ Add tags for decks
 ☐ Filter decks by tags
 ☐ Filter cards by set
 ☐ Make it so you can bulk update cards (enter the number directly)
 ☐ Add tenancy (and authentication)
 ☐ Group picklist by card set
 ☐ Figure out how to be more tolerant of split cards during order/picklist generation (e.g. Flower/Flourish, Flower / Flourish, Flower//Flourish, Flower // Flourish)
 ☐ Show number of cards in deck??
 ☐ show deck name on order page

Technical Initiatives
 ☐ Use GraphQL?
 ☐ Improve searching w/ elastic search?
 ☐ Tests!
